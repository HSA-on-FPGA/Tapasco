.SH NAME
tapasco-api.h \- Header include for libtapasco(3), define Tapasco API.
.SH DESCRIPTION
TaPaSCo microarchitectures consist of two parts: The
.I Architecture
and the
.I Platform.
Architecture is resonsible for the organization and wiring of the processing
elements, as well as their control interface. Platform is responsible for the
rest of the design, e.g., the communication to the host, access to memory,
peripherals.
.PP
tpc-api.h defines the user-facing API for applications, i.e., the interface
user applications program against to interface with TaPaSCo hardware. It defines
methods to query bitstreams, transfer data from and to the device, configure and
launch jobs, among other things (see inline documentation).
.PP
Each Architecture provides its own implementation of tapasco-api.h in
libtapasco(3).
